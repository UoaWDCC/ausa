# AUSA Wellbeing App

Project initiated by WDCC in 2025.

## About

Student wellbeing and mental health is extremely important to AUSA. Whether you're struggling financially, looking to book for a campus care appointment, or just wanting to find a better way to navigate through the UoA official website... there's something for every student AUSA's new web app for you!

AUSA's pre-existing website has A LOT of information that is not properly organised, so students become overwhelmed and confused when accessing this web app. The design has made some of the buttons hard to distinguish, and walls of text may not be needed. Below are what we hope to accomplish in order of priority:

- Make the website easier to read and navigate through
- Implement a superior design that is calming for students and easy to navigate through
- Add a FAQs page and organise the information so that it is not overwhelming for students
- Add an External Links page to allow students to easily navigate between different UoA services
- Add a Booking System that allows students to book a Campus Care appointment through AUSA services
- Implement a "buddy system" that allows friending and messaging functionality
