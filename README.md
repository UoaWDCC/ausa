## Our Plan 📋

AUSA's pre-existing website has A LOT of information that is not properly organised, so students become overwhelmed and confused when accessing this web app. Design is also not great. Below are what we hope to accomplish in order of priority:

- Make the website easier to read
- Implement a superior design that is calming for students 
- Add a FAQs page and organise the information so that it is not overwhelming
- Add an External Links page to allow students to easily navigate between different UoA services
- Add a Booking System that allows students to book a Campus Care appointment through AUSA services
- Implement a "buddy system" that allows friending and messaging functionality

## local testing 
```bash
yarn dev-client
```

```bash
yarn dev-server
```
